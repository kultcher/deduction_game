# Agent handoff log

Shared notes between Claude (checks, tests, Git) and Argon (main coding). Newest entry
first. Each entry: who, when, base commit, status, next actor, and anything the other
agent must know before starting.

Ground rules (from Nov 3, until Michael changes them):

- Argon delivers work as a zip on Drive (full files plus a manifest) and names the
  `base_commit` it was built on. Claude unpacks it on a branch from that commit, so later
  fixes are merged, never overwritten.
- `main` only moves when everything is green: `dotnet build`, the selected suites, and
  (from C1 on) a golden capture identical to `tools/golden/baseline_82faa5b` at `--tol 0`.
  Otherwise the work stays on its branch and the entry says why.
- Two failed attempts at the same problem: stop, mark `BLOCKED_NEEDS_MICHAEL`, write the
  exact error. No force pushes, nothing irreversible.

## 2026-11-03 05:43 ET, Claude: no new slice yet

- Checked Drive and `main`: no slice newer than `patch_001_slice_c0.zip`, and no new
  notes from Argon. `main` is still at the C0 entry below. Nothing to apply; stopping
  until Michael or Argon picks this up.
- Next actor: **Argon** (slice C1, or a C0b that wires the profiler first).

## 2026-11-03, Claude: slice C0 checked

- **Base:** `main` at `2273c8f` (PR #50: purge 2c/3, tuning hoist, post-purge baseline).
- **Patch:** `patch_001_slice_c0.zip` applied on `csharp/slice-c0`.
- **Status / next actor:** see the result section at the bottom of this entry.

### Container toolchain (works, offline)

- .NET SDK 8.0.133 from Ubuntu's archive; Godot 4.7.2 .NET build from GitHub releases.
- NuGet (`api.nuget.org`) and Microsoft's download sites are blocked here. The build
  resolves `Godot.NET.Sdk`, `GodotSharp` and `Godot.SourceGenerators` from the packages
  bundled with the Godot .NET download (`GodotSharp/Tools/nupkgs`) through a user-level
  NuGet config. **So C# code can't depend on any other NuGet package**: anything beyond
  the .NET base library and GodotSharp won't build in the test container.
- Tests and golden captures now run on the .NET Godot binary.

### Changes Claude made to C0

1. `project.godot`: `dotnet/project/assembly_name` changed from
   `"Demonologist (text prototype)"` to `"Demonologist"`. Godot looks for
   `<assembly_name>.csproj`, and the project file is `Demonologist.csproj`. **Michael's
   Windows editor will regenerate its own `.godot/mono` output under the new name; if it
   had a `Demonologist (text prototype).csproj` locally, that file is now unused.**
2. `tools/run_gd_tests.py`: builds `Demonologist.csproj` before running suites. It uses
   **Debug**, not Release as the manifest said: the editor binary (what headless test
   runs use) loads `.godot/mono/temp/bin/Debug`. A failed build fails the whole run.
3. `workshop/caches.gd`: `SolverBackend.clear_context()` added at the end of
   `clear_all()`, as the manifest asked.

### Notes for Argon

- **Static calls work.** GDScript calls the C# static methods on the loaded script
  (`SetMode`, `ClearContext`, `EvalMathBatch`, `VerifyFloat64Buffer`) without trouble on
  4.7.2, and `PackedFloat64Array`/`PackedInt32Array` marshal to `double[]`/`int[]`.
  Keep that pattern for C1.
- **The profiler isn't wired yet.** `SolverBackend.record_stage` and the stage list exist,
  but nothing calls them, so the C0 deliverable "late-game stage breakdown and marshalling
  budget" hasn't been measured. Suggest C1 (or a small C0b) adds timers around the real
  call sites (jury/shared_ledger outer prep, world_domain, live_activity `_likelihood`,
  case_eval compile, channel sum-product, reason attribution) behind
  `SolverBackend.profiling_enabled`, plus call counts per boundary function, and
  a `tools/profile_c0.gd` that plays seed 42 to Day 4 and prints
  `format_profile_report`. Claude will run it and post the numbers here.
- **The math audit covers a sample, not the kernel.** `test_csharp_slice_c0` checks 164
  hand-picked inputs at 0 ULP (all pass on Linux). The kernels' actual `exp`/`log`/`pow`
  call sites and argument ranges still need listing before C1; any that differ at a
  boundary need the shared implementation the plan describes.
- **Windows vs Linux check** (plan section 1.2) needs Michael's machine: run
  `tools/golden_capture.gd` there and diff it against `baseline_82faa5b`. Until then,
  only the Linux container is a valid golden platform.
- **Integer widths for C1:** `case_eval` world codes (`radix = 3^k`, `rm_bound`) need
  `long`. `Math.Round` must be `MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero` everywhere (the bridge
  does this). Pack people/cards in the same order GDScript iterates its dictionaries.
- **Golden runs need a clean log:** Godot keeps running when a script fails to compile, so
  check a capture's log for `SCRIPT ERROR` before trusting a diff. That's how two broken
  purge scripts got through on Nov 2.

### Result

- `dotnet build`: succeeds, 0 warnings (Debug and Release).
- Suites on the .NET Godot binary: `test_csharp_slice_c0` (164 checks, 0 ULP),
  `test_headline`, `test_workshop_ownership`, `test_legacy_purge_phase3`,
  `test_role_def_poc`, `test_beliefs`, `test_workshop_tuning_probe`: all pass.
  All 260 scripts parse.
- Golden capture on the .NET binary vs `baseline_82faa5b`, `--tol 0`: **all five seeds
  identical**, no script errors. So the .NET build of Godot plays the same game as the
  standard one, and C0 changed nothing.
- **Pushed to `main`.** Next actor: **Argon** (slice C1, or a C0b that wires the
  profiler first; see notes above). Claude checks Drive again around 05:40 ET.
